Junkfood is a dynamic tiling [Wayland](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay) compositor that is modular and extensible built on top of [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay).

# Note

This is not a fully working compositor. This is only a protype for learning how wayland protocols work. It does not aim to be a usable compositor (as of now).
